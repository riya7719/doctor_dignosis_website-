<!-- ================= ABOUT ================= -->
<section class="section text-section">
    <p>
        DxGPT is an augmented intelligence tool designed by and for the clinical environment.
         Unlike general-purpose AIs, it does not generate open narrative text, but a structured 
         analysis of prioritized diagnostic hypotheses, classified and reasoned with symptoms
          for and against. We use advanced language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5, within a 
          medical control framework that ensures relevance, consistency, and safety in every 
          result. We do not replace clinical judgment: we enhance it. We offer you an instant 
          differential analysis that saves time, neutralizes cognitive biases, and raises the 
          quality of clinical reasoning from the very first moment.

<!-- ================= CHALLENGE ================= -->
<section class="section challenge">
    

     <h3><span class="red">The </span> challenge of clinical diagnosis</h3>
     <br>
    <p>
       Diagnosis, especially in rare diseases, is a labyrinth of data and symptoms that 
       consumes time and generates uncertainty. With over 10,000 rare diseases, most unknown
        to the average professional due to their low prevalence, familiarity is an impossible
         luxury. DxGPT acts as a powerful cognitive offloading tool, speeding up analysis and
          broadening the spectrum of possibilities to arrive at an accurate diagnosis sooner.
           In this context, support technology is no longer an option, but a necessity for patient
            safety and quality of care.
    </p>
</section>


<section class="section challenge">
    

     <h3><span class="red">Why </span> DxGPT and not a general-purpose AI?</h3>
     <br>
    <p>
      Conversational tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini are broad-spectrum language models.
       In the medical context, this flexibility is a fundamental weakness. Their unstructured 
       nature can generate variable, incomplete, or clinically irrelevant responses, lacking the
        essential safety controls for high-risk decision-making.

            <h2>Structured and consistent analysis</h2>
            <p>
                While a generalist AI produces free text, DxGPT offers a rigorous and 
                reproducible analysis of prioritized diagnostic hypotheses. Each hypothesis
                includes compatible and incompatible symptoms, challenging confirmation
                and availability bias, and ensuring consistent, explainable results.

            <i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"></i>
            <h2>Clinical control framework</h2>
            <p>
               DxGPT operates within a control environment designed to mitigate the risks
                inherent in large language models (LLMs). Its architecture and results are 
                supervised by healthcare professionals to ensure that the responses are not
                 only technically correct, but also clinically relevant and safe.

            <h2>Specialization in rare diseases</h2>
            <p>
                DxGPT is designed to systematically include rare diseases in the differential 
                diagnosis, an area where generalist systems, and often human reasoning, can fail.
                 The system integrates specialized knowledge to detect atypical patterns and 
                 explore hypotheses that would otherwise be ignored, expanding the clinician's 
                 diagnostic radar and improving the chances of an early and accurate diagnosis.

      <center><div class="icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-clock"></i></div></center>
      <h3>Reclaim time for what matters most: the patient</h3>
      <p>
        DxGPT automates the generation of the differential diagnosis, transforming 
        minutes of search and uncertainty into seconds of structured analysis. This 
        efficiency frees up the healthcare professional to focus on clinical judgment
        , patient communication, and decision-making.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <center><div class="icon"><i class="fa-regular fa-eye"></i></div></center>
      <h3>From data chaos to diagnostic clarity</h3>
      <p>
        We present information in a clean, structured format, designed 
        for clinical thinking. Hypotheses are displayed with symptoms for
         and against, allowing for quick evaluation and safer, more informed
          decision-making.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <center><div class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i></div></center>
      <h3>A tool, not an application</h3>
      <p>
       Unlike conversational AIs, DxGPT's interface is optimized for a single function: 
       supporting diagnosis. Every element is designed to guide clinical reasoning 
       efficiently and safely, eliminating distractions and focusing on practical utility.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <center><div class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i></div>/center>
      <h3>A safety system against mental shortcuts</h3>
      <p>
        Clinical diagnosis is vulnerable to cognitive biases such as availability 
        or confirmation bias. DxGPT acts as an objective counterweight, systematically 
        presenting a range of possibilities based on the case evidence, including rare 
        diseases. This promotes a more thorough evaluation and reduces the risk of diagnostic 
        errors, improving patient safety.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <center><div class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i></div></center>
      <h3>Standardize diagnostic excellence</h3>
      <p>
        DxGPT ensures that each case is analyzed with the same methodological rigor,
         regardless of the professional or the moment. This consistency reduces variability 
         in the quality of care and establishes a high standard of analysis for the entire team. 
         Our performance is continuously validated against a demanding bank of clinical cases to
          ensure constant reliability.

    </div>
<div class="card">
      <center><div class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i></div></center>
      <h3>Created in clinical practice, for clinical practice</h3>
      <p>
        DxGPT is not a laboratory product. It has been developed in a continuous cycle 
        of collaboration with frontline doctors, hospitals, and scientific societies. 
        Its design and functionalities respond to the real challenges of diagnosis, 
        ensuring that it is not only technologically advanced, but also clinically useful,
         relevant, and easy to integrate into the professional's mental workflow.

    </div>

    <p>
        <br>
        Our research has revealed a critical factor: the quality of an LLM's response depends decisively on the quality of the question. Therefore, we have developed and validated over 30 prompt formulations (instructions) to find the optimal structure that activates effective and consistent clinical reasoning.<br><br>

This expert control over formulation is what differentiates DxGPT from a generalist AI. We do not leave the quality of the result to chance; we have designed a process that ensures that, for the same case, the system always applies the same analytical rigor, producing reliable and reproducible results.<br>

<section class="headingg">
<h1>An evaluation methodology that thinks like a clinician</h1><br>


<p>Measuring accuracy goes beyond a simple 'correct' or 'incorrect'. Our 3-level cascade evaluation process measures what really matters in clinical practice:</p><br>
<h2><div class="number">1</div>Objective Verification</h2><br>


<p>Compares the main hypothesis with standardized medical codes (SNOMED CT, ICD-10) as the 'strictest validation line'.</p><br>
<h2><div class="number">2</div>Clinical Context Analysis</h2><br>


<p>If there's no exact match, an 'expert AI' evaluates if the response is a valid clinical synonym (e.g., 'acute renal failure' vs. 'acute kidney injury'), recognizing successes that simple text analysis would ignore.</p><br>
<h2><div class="number">2</div>Quality of Prioritization</h2><br>


<p>This is our most innovative metric. It's not enough for the correct diagnosis to be on the list; its average position is measured. A correct diagnosis in the first position is 'infinitely more useful than in the fifth,' and this metric evaluates DxGPT's ability to 'prioritize like a specialist, offering maximum clinical relevance in the shortest possible time'.</p><br>
